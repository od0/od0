I’m excited to kick off a series of posts where I will share what I’m building and why, as well as what I’m seeking to learn. There’s an additional goal of helping share meaningful and relevant knowledge to people working on similar problems.

Quick background: I’ve been working on data infrastructure for almost a decade, with some forays into complementary technology spaces (such as deep learning, orchestration and automation, data science and analytics, network engineering and observability). The anchor points along the way have primarily been grounded in value that I’ve been able to create for other people through data (especially teams working in large enterprises). 

Like many of you, I was curious about the advancements in generative AI two years ago, and looked for ways to explore and play, as well as build and search for ways to add value in the space. For such a new and rapidly moving problem space, it seemed to be full of solved problems. I’ve always been an infra geek–left alone with a full stack of things to fix, I will tend to gravitate towards the things that feel like how I interacted with computers growing up. More so than writing software, I was drawn to poking at things, optimizing settings, making things run better. I’ve ended up doing a lot of that over the years.

For reasons that perhaps warrant a separate post, I didn’t see a lot of opportunity to add value at the infrastructure level for generative AI. In hindsight, this wasn’t strictly true, and some of the ideas I had and wrote off have turned out to be worth building by others. But I’ve ended up building Other Things, and finding ways to add value, and generally enjoying what I’m doing. 

But that urge to dabble–that sense that I have some sense of what the future will or should look like–has only grown. And I see these two worlds, one in which I Add Value, one in which I Am Curious, rapidly coming together.

There’s parallels between my personal ambitions and interests and generative AI. We’re both caught in between these worlds of adding concrete value versus remaining curious and doing things that might fail or might just end up being toys, but offer value in a different way.
