Unraveled, unwound. Unloving, unbound.
Adversarial in nature, knowing no knowns.
Fear belore finding and efforts in nouns.
Words worth wording, wherever they weigh.
Heavily, heaving, higher, helpless. Helpfully
vague. Haughtily unfazed. Unweathered,
untethered, veering towards fame. Finding my
eyes, my voice in my head. Just one more
color, a new sound, a new bed. Lay my
dead down for one more glorious sleep.
Unfashioned, unabashed, beneath skeleton sheep.
Words worth knowing, and whether they blend.
Whether they cater, kowtow, behovely bend.
Under four stars that shine through cityfolk
breath, though a skylight above, once more,
a daleth.
